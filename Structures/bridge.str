# Input file for TRUSS.py program
# All commands must be written with uppercase characters
# *** The values MUST be written in the exact following line of a command
# Only lines with the command and nothing more counts. Everything else will be neglected. Even hastags are useless :)
# The order of the commands is indifferent.
#
# Commands and their format (example):
# dof - Degree of freedom: 3
# ELEMENTS - Elements given by end-nodes: 0, 1 | 0, 2 ...
# COORDINATES - Nodal coordinates: 0, 0, 0, | 0, 3., 0. ...
# CROSS-SECTIONS - This data will be evaluated in Python: 36, 5.0*(10**(-4)) ...
# MATERIALS - This data will be evaluated in Python: 1800, 100.0*(10**9) ...
# FORCES - Selected dof + Force: 11, +1000000.0 | 12, +1000000.0 ...
# SUPPORTS - Selected dof + Prescribed displacement: 0, 0.0 | 1, 0.0 ...
# MEASUREMENTS - Selected node's dof will be analyzed during Model Updating: 4X, 4Y, 10Z, ...
# EOF - For compatibility reasons EOF should be placed after the commands
#
# Optional:         
#_ORIGIN - Defines the number of the first element during reading input. The default is 0.
#  Should be placed at the TOP OF THE FILE!
